  - Questions
    - Small interview question that will make you practice this topic: [Ordered Set](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/find-in-ordered-set)
      - (_)Solution is as same as the normal source code_)
    - [A bit harder](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/find-duplicate-optimize-for-space) _For this question there are another ways to solve it and they are more efficient. But for the sake of our practice solve it with binary search_
