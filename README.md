# ACM-ICPC Preparation 
_Ongoing Project_

This program developed to learn Algorithms for using in Competitive Prorgamming, **but can be used for:**
  - Competitive Programming
  - Practicing for Interviews
  - Improving Algorithmic Thinking
  - Practicing for College Class
  - FUN

**The course requires:** 
  - To know at least one programming language well. (_You have to be able to use the language efficiently._)
  - You have to be familiarize with some of the basic Data Structures (Array, Stack, Queue, etc.) (_Although if you don't know some of them, you may learn it when you come accross._)
  
######_PS: I am saying "Any programming language" but in this course mostly we used C, C++ and some Java. But still you can follow the curriculum without any knowladge of these languages_

In the program there is only guidence, so we did not add many content apart from that already exist. We just collected good sources to learn in one place, so that one can follow up and learn. The course includes Algorithms and a bit Data Structures. You need to follow the the curriculum week by week.

**Basic fallowing guide would be to:**
  1. See the sources to study
  2. Get the logic and try to code it without looking other codes
  3. When you stuck(You really should try first) or when you done, look at the source codes, and compare it with yours, so that you can see what would be the best approach about that Algorithm. You may not like others, or you may find some of them useful.
  4. After feeling comfortable with the code itself, try to solve the questions
  5. When you done with solving or stuck (Again ...) check others solutions and try to understand your mistake or (if exists) better aproach.
 
## Resources

In this course we will use some tools for the questions. As I mentioned above all of these questions already exists, we just highlight them so that you can reach better. Here are the websites/tools that we use through this course:

  - [Leetcode](leetcode.com)
  - [Spoj](spoj.com)
  - [Hackerrank](hackerrank.com)
  - [Topcoder](topcoder.com)
  - [Codeforce](codeforce.com)
  - [Lightoj](lightoj.com)
  - [ACM-Timus](http://acm.timus.ru)

I gave these tools name because you may not be able to submit your solution or display the question for some websites. It would be better if you just sign up. Although it is not neccesary...
